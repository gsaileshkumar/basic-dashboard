## IMPROVEMENTS

-   Migrate to Typescript. Helps in maintainability and gives great confidence while refactoring
-   Use Next.js if possible. This is a great option which brings many additional features built-in for a cra application
-   Use react-query to decouple client state from server state
-   Usage of headless ui for components library can be considered instead of getting locked to a feature loaded component library. Can use styled-components for UI styling. Also can use library for a specific component like dropdown instead of reinventing
-   Integrate storybook for UI components which can be used for collaborating with design team

-   Current version of this project works in node version 12 and needs to be upgraded
